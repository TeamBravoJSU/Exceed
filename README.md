   When starting the game up you will see the title screen. There will be as play button and a level select button. The play button will start the game at the first level. Level select will allow you start any level of your choosing.
   
   You move with the arrows keys. The corresponding arrow key will move in that direction. You will use the x button to fire. The c button will release a bomb and it will remove all enemy projectiles and destroy all non-boss enemies on the screen. You have three bombs and three lives. You also have a yellow hp bar in the bottom of the screen. Your score is displayed in the top-left corner. You acquire score when destorying enemies. The boss in each stage will appear after so much score is acquired.
   
   After finishing all 3 stages the credits will roll!
